# üí´ About Me:
Currently, I am working on a personal project that involves developing an e-commerce website using Angular. The project is still in its early stage, and i am continuously adding new features to it.<br>I am looking to collaborate with other Angular developers who have experience working on large-scale web applications. I am interested in developing a robust and scalable application that can handle a large number of users.<br>I am looking for help with optimising the performance of my Angular applications. Specifically, interested in learning more about techniques for improving the page load speed and reducing the time it takes for users to interact with the application.<br>I am currently learning more about server-side rendering and how it can be used to improve the performance of your Angular applications. I also exploring new front-end frameworks and technologies to keep up with the latest trends in web development.<br>You can ask me about any of the projects that you have worked on in the past or any challenges that you have faced while working on web development projects. I'll be happy to discuss your experience working with Angular and how it compares to other front-end frameworks.<br>A fun fact about my GitHub projects is that I have contributed to several open-source projects, including a library of reusable Angular components. My contributions have not yet recognised by the community but I have received positive feedback for my attention to detail and clean coding practices.
